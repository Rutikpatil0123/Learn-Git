     * Given an integer array nums, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.


        Examples:
        Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 0

        Output: 4

        Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

        Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 3

        Output: -1

        Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
