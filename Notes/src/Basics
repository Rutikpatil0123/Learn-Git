/*
1. Java is object oriented programming language.

2. Object is instance of Class.
    A. It is real world entity
    B. Object has properties and functions.

3. Class is a template for object.
4. Class is a blueprint for object.
5. Class is a collection of properties

Example:

Student engineer = new Student();

/*******************
 * OOPS fundamentals
 *
 * 1. Data Abstraction
 *
 * It hides the complexity and shows essential functionality to the user.
 * It is achieved through interface and abstract class.
 * Increases the security and confidentiality.
 * Example: User sends a text message to the user, but he is unknown to undelaying implementation.
 *
 * Interface Imessage{
 *
 *      Send_Text(){
 *
 *      }
 *
 *      Send_Email(){
 *
 *       }
 *
 *      Send_WhatsApp(){
 *
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * 2. Data Encapsulation
 *
 *  Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods together into a single unit.
 *  It is also known as data hiding
 *  It is achieved through the use of access modifiers.
 *
 *  Access modifiers are used to control the access of data and methods.
 *
 *  There are 4 access modifiers in java
 *
 *  1. public
 *  2. private
 *  3. protected
 *  4. default
 *
 *  we can also use access modifiers to restrict the access of data and methods
 *  We can write loosely coupled code and have better access and security
 *  Using a class and getter and setter methods we wrap data in single unit
 *
 *
 * 3. Inheritance  --> extends
 *
 * Capability of a class to inherit the properties of another class
 * code reusability
 * single inheritance
 * multilevel inheritance
 * hierarchical inheritance
 * Multiple inheritance is not possible in java we achieve that behoove from interface
 * Diamond problem occurs if we try to inherit from multiple classes because they can have same methods it can
 * cause confusion which one to use.


 *
 * 4. Polymorphism

 * Poly means to many forms
    A same method, behave differently in different situations

    Types of polymorphism

    compile time / static polymorphism / method Overloading
    run time / dynamic polymorphism / Method Overriding


    Compile time polymorphism

    method overloading : same method name but different parameters
    return type does not matter


    run time polymorphism

    method overriding : same method name and same parameters
    using inheritance

 5. Object relationship

 IS-A-Relationship

 Dog is a Animal

 Parent child relationship

 Has-A-Relationship

 One Class has a object of another Class
 It can be one-to-one one to many many to many

Association in between two objects

Aggregation: both object can serve individually.
Composition : Ending one object will end another object



JDK

Java is platform independent language

WORA --> Write once, Run anywhere

JDK --> JRE --> JVM

Java Program --> Complier --> Bytecode --> JVM --> Machine Code -->CPU --> Output

JIT --> just in time complier

JRE ==> JVM + class library

JDK ==> JRE(JVM + class library) + java language + java complier + debugger

 *


 Java Program

    There should be only one public class in java same as file name
    Main method is public and static so JVM can directly call it with class name
    Main method is the entry point of the program. JVM will call main method

Java variable rules:

    Java is case sensitive
    Java is strongly typed
    Java is statically typed
    Java variables can not start with number
    Java variables follow camelcase

    Data Types

    Primitive data type

    Char

    Char --> 2 Byte  range 0 to 65535

    Signed compiles of 2
    byte --> 1 Byte  range -128 to 127 default 0
    short --> 2 Byte  range -32768 to 32767
    int --> 4 Byte  range -2147483648 to 2147483647
    long --> 8 Byte  range -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
    float --> 4 Byte  range 1.4E-45 to 3.4E+38
    double --> 8 Byte  range 4.9E-324 to 1.8E+308
    boolean --> 1 Byte  range true or false

    Use BIginter for presision


    Reference data types

    Class

    There no pass by reference in java we use objects to pass reference

    String

    String are stored inside string pool where sme string holds same reference to strings
    String are immutable in java
    To create new string in heap use new keyword

    Interface

    while implementing interface we have override the method and provided body
    we can hold reference of concrete object in parent interface

    Class Car implements vehicle{
    }

    vehicle car = new Car();

    Arrays

    int arr[] = new int[5];

    Reference data types

    Integer



    Access Specifiers

    Public : can be accessed in any class and any package (Global)
    Private : can be accessed in same class
    protected : can be access in same package & it can be accessed by child classes from different package
    default : can be accessed in classes from same package


    Method name:

    small_Letter Camale case


    #### Method types

    Static method: IT is associated with class

    Class_name.method

    static method can not call instance variable
    static method can not be overridden

    method can be static when it not changing any instance variable

    Final:

    It is declared when you don't want to change the implementation
    It can not be overridden

    Abstract

    Abstract method is only resides in abstract class
    IT does not have any implementation
    Child class has to implement the abstract method


    Constructors

    Constructor should be same as class name
    It is used for object initialization
    It does not have any return type
    It can not be static / final / abstract

    Types:

        Default
        No args
        Parameterized
        constructor overloaded
        private constructor
        constructor changing
                this
                super

    Memory Management

    Stack:
        Stack stores temporary variables & methods get a block in stack
        Each thread has separate stack

    Heap:

        Heap is a shared memery


    Garbage collection

        Young generation Old Generation Meta space

        Object created are stored in YG and gradually promoted in OG

        YG

        Eden S1 S0


    Class types

    Concrete class : class for which we can create instance
    abstract class : no implementation
    super class and sub class: All the classes has Object super class by default
    Nested classes:
        Inner class
        Anonymous class : class without name
        Member Inner class
        Local Inner class
        Static nested class

    POJO : Plain old java objects
    Contains variables getters and setters
    class should be public
    public default constructor
    No annotations
    It should not extend or implement any class or interface


    Enums:

    Collection of constants
    all the members in enum are static and constants
    It can not extend any class as it by default extends java.lang.enum class
    it can implement interface
    It can not be initialized or extended by another class

    Singleton class


    Java Collections and framework

    Iterable the parent interface

    Collection : is a part of collection framework. & It's interface which contains various methods which is
                   is implemented by various classes like arraylist, stack, linkedlist

    collections : It is utility class and provides static methods which are used to operate like sort swap
                    search reverse
